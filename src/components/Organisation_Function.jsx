                    implementation in all the research Councils under its aegis.
                    However, since the Council did not have any subordinate
                    offices till the year 2024, the council could not implement
                    the policy. With the inauguration of two CRIYNs at
                    Nagamangala (Karnataka) and jhajjar (Haryana) on 21.01.2024
                    and 25.02.2024, respectively, the Council is in the process
                    to fill up newly sanctioned posts at these institutes. Once
                    sanctioned posts are filled up, the Council will implement
                    the above said "Rotational Transfer Policy" of Ministry of

                    dated 05.11.2020 has issued "Rotational Transfer Policy" for
                    implementation in all the research Councils under its aegis.
                    However, since the Council did not have any subordinate
                    offices till the year 2024, the council could not implement
                    the policy. With the inauguration of two CRIYNs at
                    Nagamangala (Karnataka) and jhajjar (Haryana) on 21.01.2024
                    and 25.02.2024, respectively, the Council is in the process
                    to fill up newly sanctioned posts at these institutes. Once
                    sanctioned posts are filled up, the Council will implement
                    the above said "Rotational Transfer Policy" of Ministry of
                    Ayushin letter and sprit.
